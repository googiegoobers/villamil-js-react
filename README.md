MSAD JS-REACT-EXPLORATION ACTIVITY



PART B - REACT

An incredibly simple website that nerely demonstrates the basic components of React. I had to look at tutorials since I had no idea where to start with react. I had downloaded Node.js and 
followed a tutorial to set up the environment. There were 3 required components, and I had to combine 2 which was the counter and the student info form. Since there was a Vite+React template available, that was what I used. The only jsx form I used was the main and I imported a new css file which was named WelcomeCard.css.



Features

Following are the features and learnings in this project:
Had 3 functions inside main.jsx:
WelcomeCard - I made it as a pop-up to welcome the site's visitor. Added greetings and a button that essentially closes the pop-up.
StudentInfoCard - It contains the form which includes the counter component. Student name, number and age was asked. The student's name
and number were intialized simlarly while the age was where the counter component was used. I also added increment and decrement buttons for the age 
which started at 0.
App - This function was used to call all my other functions and also a code block to create that pop-up effect.
I learned about making cards and also input/ input types. I also learned about buttons and their different types.
